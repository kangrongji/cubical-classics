-- We record up axioms to make use of Agda's instance argument,
-- so no one needs to write them everywhere explicitly.


-- Introducing ðŸ¤–,
-- who is an honorific member of Oracle Machines
-- and also a legal term of Oracle (namely `ðŸ¤– : Oracle`).
-- It knows everything about h-propositions more than you could ever imagine!

-- In case you need its help,
-- please add `module _ â¦ƒ ðŸ¤– : Oracle â¦„` on top of your codes.
-- To call him somewhere,
-- please `open Oracle ðŸ¤–` and apply the function `decide`.
-- Examples are almost all files in this library.

-- CLARIFICATION:
-- There are horrific rumors among some constructivists,
-- about how evil, filthy and atrocious ðŸ¤– is,
-- about eating babies and corruption of the youth.
-- ABSOLUTE NONSENSE!!!
-- ðŸ¤– is kind, decent and peaceful.
-- Neighbors speak highly of ðŸ¤–.
-- But one thing...
-- Sometimes ðŸ¤– knows the answer,
-- but ðŸ¤– won't tell anyone.
