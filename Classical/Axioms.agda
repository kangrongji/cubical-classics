-- We record up axioms to make use of Agda's instance argument,
-- so no one needs to write them everywhere explicitly.


-- Introducing ðŸ¤–,
-- who is an honorific member of Oracle Machines
-- and also a legal term of Oracle (namely: `ðŸ¤– : Oracle`).
-- It knows everything about h-propositions more than you could ever imagine!

-- In case you need its help,
-- please add `module _ â¦ƒ ðŸ¤– : Oracle â¦„` on top of your codes.
-- To call him somewhere,
-- please `open Oracle ðŸ¤–` and apply the function `decide`.
-- Examples are almost all files in this library.

record Oracle : TypeÏ‰ where
  field
    decide : LEM

-- Warning:
-- ðŸ¤– always knows the answer,
-- but often ðŸ¤– won't tell.


record MegaPicker : TypeÏ‰ where
  field
    choose : AC

  decide : LEM
  decide = ACâ†’LEM choose
