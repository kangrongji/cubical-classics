The aim of `cubical-classics` library is to formalize classical mathematics using cubical type theory.
Though still a baby project at present, I hope someday it will have some important ideas of modern mathematics eventually.

We are open to advices and contributions!

### Dependency
Depend on [the Cubical Agda standard library](https://github.com/agda/cubical), keeping up with the newest (maybe not publicly released yet) version.
